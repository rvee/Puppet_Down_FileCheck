# Puppet_Down_FileCheck
A Script to SSH multiple Linux hosts simultaneously to find a file and display the content of the file.


This Script needed to be improved, SSH to multiple hosts parallely and find a file (/service/puppet/down) and cat the content of the file.

#Host details should be taken out from another file.
